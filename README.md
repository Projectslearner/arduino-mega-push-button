# Push Button

#### Project Overview

The Push Button project demonstrates how to interface a push button with an Arduino Mega. Push buttons are simple mechanical switches used to control circuits by making or breaking a connection.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Push Button**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Push Button to Arduino Mega:**
   - **buttonPin**: Digital pin connected to one leg of the push button (e.g., pin 2).
   - **GND**: Connect the other leg of the push button to GND on Arduino Mega.
   - **Internal Pull-up Resistor**: Enable the internal pull-up resistor on the button pin to ensure stable readings.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the push button to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Library or Dependencies:**
   - No additional libraries are required for basic push button interfacing.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

4. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud) to monitor the push button state.
   - Press the button and observe "Button pressed!" messages in the Serial Monitor when the button is pressed.

#### Applications

- **User Input:** Used in various projects for user interaction and control.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Trigger actions or events based on button presses.

#### Notes

- **Debouncing:** Implement a debounce delay (e.g., 500ms) to handle mechanical switch bounce and ensure accurate detection of button presses.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Use external pull-down resistors for more precise control over the button state.
- **Multiple Buttons:** Extend the concept to handle multiple buttons by assigning each to different digital pins.
